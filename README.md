After completing the Bootcamp, I feel well-prepared to step into the next phase of my career. I’ve gained essential technical skills that will allow me to work effectively as a web developer. The hands-on projects have also given me confidence in my abilities. I’m particularly excited about pursuing opportunities in full-stack development, and I look forward to contributing to real-world projects.

## Skills Gained During the Bootcamp
